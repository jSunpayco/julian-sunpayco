        description: "A project that was given to us in college during for our Predictive Analysis subject was data visualization. Our professor specifically instructed us to explore Tableau and come up with a presentation on any dataset we could find on the internet. I found the lesson valuable not only in undestanding data, but also when trying to understand situations in general as it helped us be more critical on what's going on given the data presented to be able to create a story that could guide us towards a certain direction.",

This is the product of a group project I participated in during an entrepreneurship subject directed towards software developers. The development of the project began from determining the existence of a certain market and ended with providing a minimum viable product for their problems. After creating the original prototype using Figma, the design and overall structure was modified after every iteration that included UX testing with target customers.",

        description: "My first internship; I was initially given a task to review a security scan analysis generated by Zap OWASP. A general walkthrough of Burp Suite and the common vulnerabilities of a web application was also provided for the initial scans, in which I was tasked to do them alone for the succeeding ones. But the main role given to me afterwards was to perform tasks for the web component of an attendance and inventory monitoring system tailored for merchandising services. This made me gain experience in a JavaScript framework for the first time, specifically Angular. Additionally, some of the tickets assigned to me had me dabble a bit into AWS functions, such as when I had to implement multipart uploading for larger sized files. Although the 4 months felt like a breeze, it was still an exciting and fruitful experience to get to work on a larger-scaled project when compared to personal works.",

        description: "My first take on a full-stack project where I had decided to branch out of just learning one JavaScript framework and decided to go for React. Hearing from friends and reading other testimonies online on the so-called more streamlined version of a JS framework, I was obviously curious how different it could be from Angular. Turns out, the reusablility part of React is what drew developers towards it. By creating a template that can be used as many times as you want, you wouldn't need to do so much to perform changes.",

However, you'd need not to worry if you have nothing to share as you, the public, will still have access to the different recipes shared by the application's users.
